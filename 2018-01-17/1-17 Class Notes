Supervised Learning:

1) Linear Regression: Continuosu Values
2) Logistic Regression: Discrete / Binary Classification
3) Decision Trees:  Classification 
        - Binary (0 | 1)
        - Multi-Classification
        - Parent Nodes
        - Leaf Nodes

4) Entropy - Randomness / Order / Chaos
5) Information Gain - How much was learned from splitting the data.

A decision tree stops making nodes with the entropy is 0.

max_depth - use this parameter to determine which depth of the tree to go down to.
